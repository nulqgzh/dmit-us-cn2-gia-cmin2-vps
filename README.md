Looking for a reliable US VPS with direct routes to China? DMIT just restocked their popular Los Angeles CN2 GIA and CMIN2 line VPS plans. Whether you're running cross-border e-commerce, need stable connections for remote work, or want to deploy services with optimal China-US connectivity, these plans deliver solid performance without breaking the bank—starting from just $36.9 per year.

## What Makes DMIT Worth Considering?

DMIT.io has been around since 2018, focusing on premium network routes rather than racing to the bottom on price. They run data centers in Los Angeles, San Jose, Hong Kong, and Japan, with a specialty in CN2 GIA connections—the gold standard for China-optimized routing.

What caught my attention this time is their restocked inventory on two specific routes: CN2 GIA (starting at $36.9/year) and CMIN2 (starting at $39.9/year). Both are triple-optimized (China Telecom, China Unicom, China Mobile all use premium routes), which means consistent low latency whether your users are in Beijing, Shanghai, or Guangzhou.

## Los Angeles CMIN2 Plans: The Specs

Here's what's currently available:

| CPU | RAM | Storage | Traffic | Price | 
|-----|-----|---------|---------|-------|
| 1 Core | 1GB | 20GB | 1TB/1Gbps | $39.9/year |
| 1 Core | 1GB | 20GB | 1.5TB/1Gbps | $49.9/year |
| 2 Cores | 2GB | 40GB | 2.5TB/4Gbps | $100/year |

The bandwidth allocations here are pretty generous. That 4Gbps option on the annual $100 plan is genuinely hard to find at this price point. All plans run on AMD EPYC processors (recent upgrade from their older Intel lineup), come with both IPv4 and IPv6, and some tiers let you swap IPs every 15 days if needed.

These are limited-stock promotional prices with lifetime renewal rates—meaning you lock in this pricing permanently, not just for the first term.

## Who's This Actually For?

**Cross-border businesses:** If you're shipping products between China and the US, or running payment gateways that need to talk to both regions fast, the triple-optimized routing makes a real difference. I've seen 40-60ms latency improvements over standard routes.

**Content creators with Chinese audiences:** Streaming, file distribution, or even just serving a WordPress site—CN2 GIA and CMIN2 routes keep things smooth when your viewers are behind the Great Firewall.

**Developers testing services:** Need to QA how your app performs for users in mainland China? Having a VPS on these premium routes gives you realistic testing conditions without VPN overhead.

👉 If you're looking to deploy services that need solid China connectivity without the complexity of managing split routing yourself, [DMIT's CN2 GIA and CMIN2 infrastructure handles the heavy lifting](https://www.dmit.io/aff.php?aff=13832) so you can focus on your actual work instead of network engineering.

## The "But Wait, There's More" Details

DMIT accepts PayPal, Alipay, and credit cards—no wire transfers or cryptocurrency drama. Their control panel is straightforward (no bloated custom interfaces), and you get root access to do whatever you need.

One thing to note: these promotional slots sell out fast. The annual plans especially, since the pricing is locked in permanently. Once they're gone, you're waiting for the next restock cycle, which could be months.

The bandwidth limits might look tight at first glance (1-2.5TB monthly), but on premium routes, that goes further than you'd think. Most small-to-medium projects won't hit those caps unless you're serving large files to thousands of users.

## Why Not Just Use Generic US Hosting?

Fair question. Standard US VPS providers are cheaper—you can find $2-3/month plans all over the place. But here's what you're not getting:

**Routing quality:** Regular US hosting takes whatever path is cheapest through the internet. That often means multiple hops through congested nodes, packet loss during peak hours, and latency spikes when submarine cables get busy.

**Predictable performance:** CN2 GIA and CMIN2 are physical infrastructure investments. You're paying for dedicated fiber routes that bypass the usual internet traffic jams between China and the US.

**Support that understands the use case:** DMIT's team knows you're probably dealing with China-specific networking challenges. They're not going to be confused when you ask about BGP routing or peering arrangements.

If your users are primarily in North America or Europe, generic hosting is fine. But if even 20-30% of your traffic comes from mainland China, the premium routing pays for itself in reduced troubleshooting and better user experience.

## What About Alternatives?

Sure, there are other CN2 GIA providers. Bandwagon Host (搬瓦工) is probably the most famous, with similar routing quality but typically higher starting prices. Some regional providers offer IPLC (International Private Leased Circuit) connections, which are even faster but start around $20-30/month minimum.

DMIT sits in a sweet spot: professional-grade routing without enterprise pricing. You're not paying for premium support you don't need, but you're also not gambling on whether the "CN2" in a cheap provider's marketing is actually implemented correctly.

## Setting Realistic Expectations

This isn't magic. You're still subject to China's internet policies—if a service gets blocked at the border, no amount of premium routing will help. And during major political events or crackdowns, even CN2 routes can see slowdowns.

The 15-day IP rotation option is useful if you hit an unlucky IP block, but it's not a replacement for proper IP reputation management. And while AMD EPYC processors are solid, these are still budget VPS specs—don't expect to run intensive database workloads on the 1GB RAM plans.

## Bottom Line

DMIT's restocked CN2 GIA and CMIN2 plans offer legitimate value if you need reliable China-US connectivity. The annual pricing starting at $36.9 locks in good economics, especially for projects that need consistent performance rather than burst capacity.

They're straightforward about what they offer (premium routing, decent hardware, no overselling), and the lifetime renewal pricing means you're not dealing with bait-and-switch tactics after year one. For small businesses, developers, or content creators who need their services accessible from both sides of the Pacific, these plans deliver exactly what they promise without unnecessary complexity.
